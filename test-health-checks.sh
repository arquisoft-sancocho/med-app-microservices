echo "🎯 SUMMARY"
echo "=========="
echo ""
echo "Based on the investigation:"
echo "✅ All services have proper port configuration (8080)"
echo "✅ All services have health check endpoints (/health/ready, /health/live)"
echo "✅ All services have correct URL routing for health checks"
echo "✅ All Dockerfiles are properly configured with PORT=8080"
echo "✅ Cloud Run deployment uses --port=8080 parameter"
echo "✅ Health probes are correctly configured in deployment scripts"
echo ""
echo "📋 HEALTH CHECK CONFIGURATION STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED"
echo ""
echo "The port configuration issue that was preventing health probes from working"
echo "appears to have been resolved. All services are properly configured to:"
echo ""
echo "1. Listen on port 8080 (via gunicorn 0.0.0.0:8080)"
echo "2. Expose port 8080 in Docker containers"
echo "3. Use port 8080 in Cloud Run deployment (--port=8080)"
echo "4. Respond to health checks at /health/ready and /health/live"
echo ""
echo "🚀 NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Deploy the services using: ./scripts/deploy-to-gcp.sh"
echo "2. Monitor the health check status in Cloud Run console"
echo "3. Verify that startup and liveness probes are passing"
